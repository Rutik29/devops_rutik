Puppet is two things: a language for expressing the desired state (how your nodes should be 
configured), and an engine that interprets code written in the Puppet language and applies it 
to the nodes to bring about the desired state.
What does this language look like? It's not exactly a series of instructions, like a shell script or 
a Ruby program. It's more like a set of declarations about the way things should be. Have a 
look at the following example:
package { 'curl':
 ensure => installed,
}
